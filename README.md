2. Click on the desired app and click on the square with the arrows facing outwards
3. Now the app is running in borderless windowed mode!<br>
<br>

  without having to do it manually, just click on the desired app and then click on the arrow facing right,<br>
  now the app should also be listed on the right half of the window, those are your favorites.

  you can just click on the app you want to remove from the list on the right side of the window, and click the arrow facing left,<br>
  the app should no longer be on the favorite list. 

### Basic Operations
